## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/liam-magargal/liam-magargal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown Test

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/liam-magargal/liam-magargal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### About Me

I am a junior in mechanical engineering at Lehigh University. I grew up in Hockessin, Delaware, where I attended Salesianum School. At Salesianum, I explored a few different potential career options by enrolling in several Advanced Placement (AP) courses. After taking the AP exams, I found recieved 29 credits from Lehigh University as an incoming first-year student. At Lehigh University, I have engaged in several organizations, including Lehigh University's Engineers Without Borders and the Community Service OFfice. Upon completion of my first year at Lehigh, I determined my best path would be to spend the summer at Lehigh taking courses to continue to get ahead. By the fall, I had essentially completely caught up with the class of 2021, and decided to focus on graduating in 2021, instead of 2022.
